<p>This plugin is for the <a href="http://www.aurelia.io/">Aurelia</a> platform. It contains custom elements for some of the <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> widgets.</p>

<p>It isn't really even alpha quality right now, as I'm still figuring out how half of this stuff works, so don't depend on anything quite yet.</p>

<p>There's <a href="demo.html">a demo that doubles as the documentation</a>. I haven't figured out bundling yet, either, so it's pretty slow, but it's functional.</p>

<p>The major "to do" list:</p>

<ul>
<li>TESTING. I have done very little, as I wasn't even sure this would be useful or implemented in a way that made sense. Now that I've used it in anger, though, I need get tests implemented ASAP.</li>
<li>Documentation via the demo app seems to be working well, but I've spent more time on layout and organization than content so far, so I need to catch up with the code so I can keep them in parity.</li>
<li>Figure out how to bundle the demo app so I can put it up somewhere.</li>
<li>Figure out how to distribute the plugin.</li>
<li>Finish making custom attributes for the rest of the Semantic widgets.</li>
<li>Finish hooking up the Modules and Behaviors further into Aurelia.</li>
</ul>

<a id="installing" class="anchor" href="#installing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing</h2>

<p>Again, this isn't released or production-ready yet, but once it is, this is how you'll install it.</p>

<p>In your project install the plugin via <code>jspm</code> with following command</p>

<pre><code>jspm install aurelia-semantic-ui
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you use <a href="http://aurelia.io/docs#startup-and-configuration">manual bootstrapping</a>. In order to do so open your <code>index.html</code> and locate the element with the attribute aurelia-app. Change it to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body aurelia-app="main"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Create (if you haven't already) a file <code>main.js</code> in your <code>src</code> folder with following content:</p>

<pre><code>export function configure(aurelia) {
  aurelia.use
    .standardConfiguration()
    .developmentLogging()
    // Install the plugin
    .plugin('aurelia-semantic-ui');

  aurelia.start().then(a =&gt; a.setRoot());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anywhere in your app add the following markup as a sample -</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ui-card class="centered"&gt;
  &lt;div class="image"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/avatar2/large/elyse.png"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="content"&gt;
    &lt;a class="header"&gt;Elyse&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the meantime, I think you can point jspm at <a href="https://github.com/ged/aurelia-semantic-ui">the Github mirror</a> to try it out. You're probably the sort of person that already knows how to do that if you're into trying out experimental code. If it's not possible for some reason, let me know, especially if you're inclined to do so via a patch.</p>
